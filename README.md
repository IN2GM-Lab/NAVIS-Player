# NAVIS-Player
NAVIS is a browser-native volumetric media player for interactive playback of dynamic PLY point-cloud sequences. It combines WebGL rendering, parallel Web Worker parsing, buffered streaming-style playback, and integrated performance metrics to enable smooth 6DoF visualization directly in the browser without native dependencies.
